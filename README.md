# Evidences and Provenance of Associations Between Concepts (EBOCA Evidences)

## Prupose and scope
This ontology aims to describe evidences and provenance of associations between concepts, in particular, biomedical concepts from paragraphs of unstructured texts. 

## Vocabulary development

This ontology is developed following the guidelines provided by the [LOT methodology](https://lot.linkeddata.es/). 

### Requirements
The requirements of the EBOCA Evidences Ontology are based on the needs of defining metadata and provenance for evidences of associations between biomedical concepts extracted from unstructured texts - paragraphs in particular.

The explicit requirements for this ontology can be found [hereTBD](tbd) and are specified with an identifier, its provenance and related ontology construct. They can be also visualized [hereTBD](tbd).

### Ontology model
The following diagram shows a general overview of the classes and properties of the Conceptual Mapping vocabulary. This diagram follows the [Chowlk notation](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation.html). For a complete description of the ontology constructs, see the [documentationTBD](tbd). The ontology code (implemented in OWL) can be found [hereTBD](tbd).
